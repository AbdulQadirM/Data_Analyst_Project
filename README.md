# Data_Analyst_Project
Hi everyone....
I recently completed a project focused on analyzing sales data for Atliq Company. In order to conduct a comprehensive analysis, I utilized both MySQL and Tableau tools. After cleaning and inspecting the data in MySQL, I seamlessly connected the MySQL server with Tableau to further enhance the visual representation of the insights gathered.

By leveraging these tools, I was able to effectively navigate and analyze complex data sets to extract meaningful insights that informed strategic decision-making for Atliq Company. My proficiency with these tools allowed for a streamlined and efficient workflow, ultimately leading to a successful project outcome.

I am excited to continue utilizing my data analysis skills and exploring new tools to provide valuable insights that drive business growth and success.
